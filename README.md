# CPS633_Cryptography
Repo of convenient crypto functions based on CPS633 lectures. Created for personal, educational use.

These files demonstrate how several crypto functions work. They can be adjusted manually to test different outcomes or variables. The files here were created for practice and are not intended to automatically provide solutions to any query, nor do they provide any specific solutions to class problems.
